# Better than Sprinting Mechanic

This mod adds sprinting to *BTA!* (*Better than Adventure!*) in a very balanced and fair way. We, the Beta Players, know that sprinting is bad and evil and unbalanced and annoying and takes the challenge out of the game and is obnoxious and modern players should stop sprinting to have fun. So I made this mod!

Also, this mod isn't really criticizing anything or anyone. It's just a joke about how many people suggest how sprinting could be implemented.
